# Vocabify
### Inspiration
In 2020, there were more than 4.9 million English language learners (ELLs) in U.S. public schools, comprising nearly 10% of students in the public school system. With a rise in digital content delivery formats for lectures and recitations, many ELL students are left behind due to a lack of understanding of terminology being used. We aim to create a comprehensive positive feedback system that both engages students in their lectures, while simultaneously helping them review new words they learn.
