hi so our group is doing a barber shop

simulation for a CS 482 final project

and um trying to optimize its efficiency

so our motivation for this was that a

lot of our group members visited the

designer Cuts barber shop located on

Green Street and barber shops are

usually subject to change all the time

in terms of service times and different

barber shops have different weight times

different styles so we wanted to

optimize designer Cuts just because it

was a place that we know um with our

simulation we hope our objectives are uh

that we want to optimize their current

service offerings to see you know should

they specialize in a certain area uh

higher adequate staff so seeing whether

they should increase or decrease the

amount of Barbers they currently have

and uh to improve customer satisfaction

by uh lowering wait uh waiting times

decreasing bulking

Etc our methodology for the following

was to create hypothetical scenarios

altered scenarios of customers entering

or exiting the shop and performing a

full service alongside waiting for a

potential haircut uh we wanted to stress

test the system with various critical

scenarios to analyze our final results

by sometimes providing minimal staff

varying the influx of customers during

peak times changing the arrival times

and also playing around a little bit

with the waiting area size so in order

to collect our data we talked to uh an

employee at Barber Shop that we're

studying and we asked him for uh in his

experience what would be realistic um

estimates for each of these following

things and um so we were able to get

good estimates on the average uh service

times the interarrival times between

customers um the size of the waiting

area and what conditions might lead to a

customer Bing after entering um so um

using his uh the the input that he gave

us we were able to put together specific

uh random variables for each of these

things and we'll go over that in the

next slide in the event graph so here we

have our event graph where so there are

multiple servers there are C servers and

N tracks the number of customers that

are in the system at a given time B is

going to keep track of the number of

customers that b t is going to keep

track of the total number of arrivals s

is going to be the number of people

served and uh W is going to be constant

that's just the size of the waiting area

and as you can see we have um kind of

the standard looking event graph for a

multi-server queue and the some of the

more complicated parts are deciding if a

customer is going to B we use this

function here um E1 to determine the B

rate basically the logic here is that uh

if there are available Barbers then

there's going to be no chance of boing

if there are no available uh Barbers and

there's um only some people in the

waiting room then uh

the B rate is going to be n Over N plus

C + 5 which is going to increase if um

there are more people in the waiting

area and it's going to decrease if

there's more Barbers so more Barbers

means less weit time and then if uh

waiting rooms all full then they're

going to Bo no matter what and then um

for the time of service we have three

different types of haircuts each with

those three probabilities 6.3 and 0.1

with those um uniform ranges of times

and then as far as times of arrival um

most customers are going to arrive in

the middle of the day in the prime of

the day and less at the beginning and

the end as um you can see we chose 29

and 13 as our means for the exponential

variables to start with our output

analysis we simulated a thousand

different working days for the barber

shop uh and we only analyzed transient

performance measures because these were

the only ones that fit the context of

our system we have a defined start and

end time so a steady state wouldn't

apply here we chose a 95% conference

interval just because again fits the

context of our project uh and getting a

larger range for our waiting times is is

unnecessary and being more precise is

also um not really helpful alongside

that as we'll show our margin of Errors

for conference intervals were low enough

that 95% confidence interval made the

most sense uh we ran uh a thousand

different iterations of IID samples and

use the following equations to find the

confence intervals uh the the uh grand

mean and the grand standard

deviation at the end of the day we use

the replication method in order to find

our confidence

intervals so here we have our output for

um each number of barbers in the shop so

we ran the simulation with two Barbers

three four and five to try to decide

which number Barbers is going to be best

for the shop and um as we could see in

our in our table here it that there is a

significant change in the mean weight

time after we add a third Barber the the

weight time goes from 34 minutes on

average to to just over 10 minutes on

average which was a huge um Improvement

but going from 3 to four only improves

the weight time um from 10 minutes to 3

minutes which which in reality is

probably not going to make a huge

difference on the number of customers

who B and um customer satisfaction and

things like that as we can see we only

got went from 34 to 38 um number of

people served on average so um it's

debatable whether or not the fourth uh

Barber is necessary I think that depends

on the specifics of how much the shop is

going to be paying them and other things

like that that uh the shop would be able

to figure out on their own and I think

clearly the fifth F Barber is not

necessary it's moving the weight mean

weight time from 3 minutes to um 1 and

1/2 minutes about is is definitely not

significant um one thing we were able to

do is reduce the uh variance on the mean

weight time the way reason we could do

this is uh because there's a negative

correlation between the arrival times

and the weight times um we're able to

use the uh antithetic uh variables using

one minus U um and then using both of

those outcomes um in order to reduce the

variance and as you could see for for

every um number of Barbers we were able

to reduce the variance on the average

weight

time now into our output analysis for

our scenario where we removed the long

haircut we wanted to see if haircut

style specialization will improve the

conditions by removing this this option

and as we can see uh changing the

service offerings only slightly improved

um the performance of the barber shop as

compared to when we had three Barbers

initially uh in our in our first output

analysis uh it seems negligent to remove

the long haircut option if it means

outreaching to more potential customers

it only affected Maybe by you know

decreasing by around a minute for mean

weight time and and maybe increasing

like just over one customer service uh

meaning that it's it's overall not uh

super big change now onto the weight

area size we wanted to also see if

changing the size of the waiting area

would affect the average waiting time

times and uh as we can see here changing

the size of the waiting area has a very

negligent effect to weight times and

service throughput and and even some

cases it worsened uh the conditions as

we can see um with uh with 10 and 20 uh

this also makes sense theoretically if

we think about it the waiting area is

only a place where customers can sit

down and wait for a open Barber if uh

let's say the waiting area was smaller

they would bulk nonetheless now you have

more customers bulking in later times

than earlier in the day when the waiting

area would be more full The Barbers

themselves aren't working faster it's

just that more people are sitting down

so buling either happens later or

before some potential sources of error

that we could have are external the

times that were given by the employee

could not maybe couldn't replicate the

real world world model to full accuracy

uh secondly the EXP exponentially

distributed arrival times might over

sandard eyesee the real world into

arrival times of customer cust so that

could you know there could be some

discre discrepancy there and there might

be some edge cases that aren't extremely

obvious that we didn't consider which

obviously could affect the service times

so our final conclusions uh hopefully

our findings can help designer Cuts make

actionable decisions to optimize their

store function and we were able to

accomplish our objectives for

identifying the number of Barbers we

suggest to stay around three or four

Barbers to ensure positive customer

experience this is again aided by more

potential data and more studies into how

much they're paying and how much they're

receiving per

cut don't aim to specialize in a

specific type of haircut the long

haircut removing option didn't really

affect service so keep your options open

can maybe potentially get more customers

and finally uh save space in the shop

and keep the waiting area as is

increasing the size again didn't really

help in optimizing their function
