"hi so our group is doing a barber shop\n\nsimulation for a CS 482 final project\n\nand um trying to optimize its efficiency\n\nso our motivation for this was that a\n\nlot of our group members visited the\n\ndesigner Cuts barber shop located on\n\nGreen Street and barber shops are\n\nusually subject to change all the time\n\nin terms of service times and different\n\nbarber shops have different weight times\n\ndifferent styles so we wanted to\n\noptimize designer Cuts just because it\n\nwas a place that we know um with our\n\nsimulation we hope our objectives are uh\n\nthat we want to optimize their current\n\nservice offerings to see you know should\n\nthey specialize in a certain area uh\n\nhigher adequate staff so seeing whether\n\nthey should increase or decrease the\n\namount of Barbers they currently have\n\nand uh to improve customer satisfaction\n\nby uh lowering wait uh waiting times\n\ndecreasing bulking\n\nEtc our methodology for the following\n\nwas to create hypothetical scenarios\n\naltered scenarios of customers entering\n\nor exiting the shop and performing a\n\nfull service alongside waiting for a\n\npotential haircut uh we wanted to stress\n\ntest the system with various critical\n\nscenarios to analyze our final results\n\nby sometimes providing minimal staff\n\nvarying the influx of customers during\n\npeak times changing the arrival times\n\nand also playing around a little bit\n\nwith the waiting area size so in order\n\nto collect our data we talked to uh an\n\nemployee at Barber Shop that we're\n\nstudying and we asked him for uh in his\n\nexperience what would be realistic um\n\nestimates for each of these following\n\nthings and um so we were able to get\n\ngood estimates on the average uh service\n\ntimes the interarrival times between\n\ncustomers um the size of the waiting\n\narea and what conditions might lead to a\n\ncustomer Bing after entering um so um\n\nusing his uh the the input that he gave\n\nus we were able to put together specific\n\nuh random variables for each of these\n\nthings and we'll go over that in the\n\nnext slide in the event graph so here we\n\nhave our event graph where so there are\n\nmultiple servers there are C servers and\n\nN tracks the number of customers that\n\nare in the system at a given time B is\n\ngoing to keep track of the number of\n\ncustomers that b t is going to keep\n\ntrack of the total number of arrivals s\n\nis going to be the number of people\n\nserved and uh W is going to be constant\n\nthat's just the size of the waiting area\n\nand as you can see we have um kind of\n\nthe standard looking event graph for a\n\nmulti-server queue and the some of the\n\nmore complicated parts are deciding if a\n\ncustomer is going to B we use this\n\nfunction here um E1 to determine the B\n\nrate basically the logic here is that uh\n\nif there are available Barbers then\n\nthere's going to be no chance of boing\n\nif there are no available uh Barbers and\n\nthere's um only some people in the\n\nwaiting room then uh\n\nthe B rate is going to be n Over N plus\n\nC + 5 which is going to increase if um\n\nthere are more people in the waiting\n\narea and it's going to decrease if\n\nthere's more Barbers so more Barbers\n\nmeans less weit time and then if uh\n\nwaiting rooms all full then they're\n\ngoing to Bo no matter what and then um\n\nfor the time of service we have three\n\ndifferent types of haircuts each with\n\nthose three probabilities 6.3 and 0.1\n\nwith those um uniform ranges of times\n\nand then as far as times of arrival um\n\nmost customers are going to arrive in\n\nthe middle of the day in the prime of\n\nthe day and less at the beginning and\n\nthe end as um you can see we chose 29\n\nand 13 as our means for the exponential\n\nvariables to start with our output\n\nanalysis we simulated a thousand\n\ndifferent working days for the barber\n\nshop uh and we only analyzed transient\n\nperformance measures because these were\n\nthe only ones that fit the context of\n\nour system we have a defined start and\n\nend time so a steady state wouldn't\n\napply here we chose a 95% conference\n\ninterval just because again fits the\n\ncontext of our project uh and getting a\n\nlarger range for our waiting times is is\n\nunnecessary and being more precise is\n\nalso um not really helpful alongside\n\nthat as we'll show our margin of Errors\n\nfor conference intervals were low enough\n\nthat 95% confidence interval made the\n\nmost sense uh we ran uh a thousand\n\ndifferent iterations of IID samples and\n\nuse the following equations to find the\n\nconfence intervals uh the the uh grand\n\nmean and the grand standard\n\ndeviation at the end of the day we use\n\nthe replication method in order to find\n\nour confidence\n\nintervals so here we have our output for\n\num each number of barbers in the shop so\n\nwe ran the simulation with two Barbers\n\nthree four and five to try to decide\n\nwhich number Barbers is going to be best\n\nfor the shop and um as we could see in\n\nour in our table here it that there is a\n\nsignificant change in the mean weight\n\ntime after we add a third Barber the the\n\nweight time goes from 34 minutes on\n\naverage to to just over 10 minutes on\n\naverage which was a huge um Improvement\n\nbut going from 3 to four only improves\n\nthe weight time um from 10 minutes to 3\n\nminutes which which in reality is\n\nprobably not going to make a huge\n\ndifference on the number of customers\n\nwho B and um customer satisfaction and\n\nthings like that as we can see we only\n\ngot went from 34 to 38 um number of\n\npeople served on average so um it's\n\ndebatable whether or not the fourth uh\n\nBarber is necessary I think that depends\n\non the specifics of how much the shop is\n\ngoing to be paying them and other things\n\nlike that that uh the shop would be able\n\nto figure out on their own and I think\n\nclearly the fifth F Barber is not\n\nnecessary it's moving the weight mean\n\nweight time from 3 minutes to um 1 and\n\n1/2 minutes about is is definitely not\n\nsignificant um one thing we were able to\n\ndo is reduce the uh variance on the mean\n\nweight time the way reason we could do\n\nthis is uh because there's a negative\n\ncorrelation between the arrival times\n\nand the weight times um we're able to\n\nuse the uh antithetic uh variables using\n\none minus U um and then using both of\n\nthose outcomes um in order to reduce the\n\nvariance and as you could see for for\n\nevery um number of Barbers we were able\n\nto reduce the variance on the average\n\nweight\n\ntime now into our output analysis for\n\nour scenario where we removed the long\n\nhaircut we wanted to see if haircut\n\nstyle specialization will improve the\n\nconditions by removing this this option\n\nand as we can see uh changing the\n\nservice offerings only slightly improved\n\num the performance of the barber shop as\n\ncompared to when we had three Barbers\n\ninitially uh in our in our first output\n\nanalysis uh it seems negligent to remove\n\nthe long haircut option if it means\n\noutreaching to more potential customers\n\nit only affected Maybe by you know\n\ndecreasing by around a minute for mean\n\nweight time and and maybe increasing\n\nlike just over one customer service uh\n\nmeaning that it's it's overall not uh\n\nsuper big change now onto the weight\n\narea size we wanted to also see if\n\nchanging the size of the waiting area\n\nwould affect the average waiting time\n\ntimes and uh as we can see here changing\n\nthe size of the waiting area has a very\n\nnegligent effect to weight times and\n\nservice throughput and and even some\n\ncases it worsened uh the conditions as\n\nwe can see um with uh with 10 and 20 uh\n\nthis also makes sense theoretically if\n\nwe think about it the waiting area is\n\nonly a place where customers can sit\n\ndown and wait for a open Barber if uh\n\nlet's say the waiting area was smaller\n\nthey would bulk nonetheless now you have\n\nmore customers bulking in later times\n\nthan earlier in the day when the waiting\n\narea would be more full The Barbers\n\nthemselves aren't working faster it's\n\njust that more people are sitting down\n\nso buling either happens later or\n\nbefore some potential sources of error\n\nthat we could have are external the\n\ntimes that were given by the employee\n\ncould not maybe couldn't replicate the\n\nreal world world model to full accuracy\n\nuh secondly the EXP exponentially\n\ndistributed arrival times might over\n\nsandard eyesee the real world into\n\narrival times of customer cust so that\n\ncould you know there could be some\n\ndiscre discrepancy there and there might\n\nbe some edge cases that aren't extremely\n\nobvious that we didn't consider which\n\nobviously could affect the service times\n\nso our final conclusions uh hopefully\n\nour findings can help designer Cuts make\n\nactionable decisions to optimize their\n\nstore function and we were able to\n\naccomplish our objectives for\n\nidentifying the number of Barbers we\n\nsuggest to stay around three or four\n\nBarbers to ensure positive customer\n\nexperience this is again aided by more\n\npotential data and more studies into how\n\nmuch they're paying and how much they're\n\nreceiving per\n\ncut don't aim to specialize in a\n\nspecific type of haircut the long\n\nhaircut removing option didn't really\n\naffect service so keep your options open\n\ncan maybe potentially get more customers\n\nand finally uh save space in the shop\n\nand keep the waiting area as is\n\nincreasing the size again didn't really\n\nhelp in optimizing their function\n\n"
